# Drug_Resistantce
The matlab code simulates a tumor within spontaneous, drug-induced, and CSC-related drug resistance. Control group (no-treatment), constant therapy, and bolus injection are compared with efficacy.)
SysODE.m has ODE function
get_parameters.m has function get_paramters to output simulations parameters and critical tumor volume (lethal volume).
FigX generates Fig. #X in project .pdf.
